# nlp_question_answer
The goal is to build a framework that is capable of answering questions of the 4th grade science exam level.  The IPython notebooks describe various methodologies proposed by us to build such a Question Answering framework.  They majorly contain the implementation for following approaches:  Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Bag-of-word matcher for answer retrieval  Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Dependency tree matcher for answer retrieval  Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Semantic Frame Matching (SEMAFOR) for answer retrieval  Semantic Frame Matching (SEMAFOR) for candidate sentence extraction + Semantic Frame Matching (SEMAFOR) for answer retrieval
